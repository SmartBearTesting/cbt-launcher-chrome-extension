Didn't know how else to get in touch!

We've just come out with a new extension for CrossBrowserTesting that allows you to instantly test like our old bookmarklet.

Any chance I can ask you to take down this project from the Chrome extension store? 

I can send some CBT swag your way if you'd like.

Thanks,
